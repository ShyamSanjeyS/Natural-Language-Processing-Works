# 🧠 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A curated collection of implementations and lab-based projects covering both foundational and advanced topics in NLP. This module reflects my hands-on learning across tokenization, parsing, word embeddings, sequence modeling, and deep learning approaches to text analysis.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

* **Basic NLP Tasks**
  Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Chunking, and Parse Tree generation using context-free grammar.

* **Statistical NLP**
  Hands-on experiments in:

  * Chi-Square Test
  * T-Test and Collocation
  * Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF
  * N-gram Modeling
  * Word Similarity and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)

* **Machine Learning for NLP**
  Applying ML algorithms to language tasks:

  * Naive Bayes for WSD
  * Word2Vec Embeddings
  * Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow

* **Sequence Modeling**
  Algorithms involving:

  * Hidden Markov Models (Forward-Backward, Viterbi, Trellis)
  * Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (Inside Probability, CYK Parsing)

* **Deep Learning**
  Text-based DL applications using:

  * LSTM-based Text Generation
  * Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

* **Other NLP Applications**

  * Information Extraction
  * Machine Translation (Rule-based and Statistical)
  * Explainable NLP workflows combining multiple modules

## ⭐ Highlights

* **From Scratch Implementations** – Most code is handwritten based on classroom labs and textbook references.
* **Simplified for Clarity** – Algorithms are broken into readable steps with visual aids where possible.
* **Structured for Education** – Lab-based progression from basics to advanced NLP techniques.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

* Basic Python programming skills
* Familiarity with language processing concepts and probability/statistics is helpful
* Required libraries:

  * `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `gensim`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn tensorflow gensim
```
