#  Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This module is a hands-on compilation of foundational and advanced NLP techniques implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Each lab and script here reflects core concepts and practical tasks from the NLP domain, aligned with academic learning and real-world applications.

---

##  Topics Covered

###  Basic NLP Tasks
- **Tokenization**: Word and sentence-level tokenization.
- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Rule-based and morphological normalization.
- **POS Tagging**: Tagging tokens with grammatical roles.
- **NER & Chunking**: Named Entity Recognition and shallow parsing.
- **Parse Trees**: Constituency parsing using context-free grammar.

###  Statistical NLP
- **Chi-square Test**
- **T-Test & Collocation**
- **Bag-of-Words & TF-IDF**
- **N-gram Models**
- **Word Similarity & WSD** (Word Sense Disambiguation)

###  Machine Learning for NLP
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** for WSD
- **Word2Vec** embeddings
- **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)** using:
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow

###  Sequence Modeling
- **Hidden Markov Models (HMM)**:
  - Forward-Backward
  - Viterbi Algorithm
  - Trellis Representation
- **Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)**:
  - Inside Probability
  - CYK Parsing

###  Deep Learning
- **Text Generation using LSTM**
- **Neural Machine Translation (NMT)**

###  Additional Topics
- **Information Extraction**
- **Machine Translation** (Rule-based and statistical)
- **Explainable Workflows** combining multiple models

| **NLP 3** | Independent notebooks on CYK, Word2Vec, Text Gen, Forward/Backward, NLTK examples |
| **NLP 4** | Organized notebooks for algorithms like PCFG, LSTM, HMM, and Disambiguation |
| **NLP 5** | All-in-one notebooks combining multiple experiments |
| **NLP 6** | Final revision-style notebooks for quick reference and integration |

##  Libraries Used

- `NLTK`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `NumPy`, `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `TensorFlow / Keras`
- `Gensim` (for Word2Vec)

---

##  Usage

Each notebook/script is self-contained and can be run in Jupyter or any Python environment with necessary libraries. To start:
```bash
pip install nltk sklearn tensorflow gensim
````

##  Notes

* Most notebooks are written from scratch based on classroom labs and reference books.
* Some files are simplified for clarity and learning.
* Labs are indexed with numbers (e.g., Lab 01 to Lab 12) for sequential learning.
